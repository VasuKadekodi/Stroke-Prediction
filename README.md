# Stroke Prediction ML Model


Do you know that stroke is one of the leading causes of death worldwide? 😱 This project aims to build a machine learning model 🤖 to predict the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on certain risk factors 📊👨‍⚕️. 

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from *healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv* 📂 and contains records of 5110 patients with 12 attributes including age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking status, etc. 📝

## Model Building

With the power of Python 🐍 and the Scikit-learn library, we built and trained the model using several algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Decision Tree and SVM 📚. We then chose the best performing algorithm based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


## Model Evaluation

To ensure our model's accuracy, we evaluated it using several performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. We compared the results with the baseline model and fine-tuned the algorithm with hyperparameter optimization to improve its performance 🤓.


## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning algorithms in predicting the likelihood of a person having a stroke based on their demographic and medical information. With our model, healthcare professionals can now identify high-risk patients and take preventive measures to reduce the incidence of strokes. 💪🏥
